		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>Ember-Share is an attempt to solve data persistence in an Ember application, it relies on <a href="http://sharejs.org/">ShareJS</a>, a battle-tested operational transforms library.</p>
		<p>In addition to just data persistence, ShareJS enables collaboration so that multiple users can concurrently modify the same model/document in real-time.</p>
		<p>Please have a look at the demos. You can get more information on the GitHub repo. Also note that the library is still in the alpha stage, but with your help we can make it better.</p>
